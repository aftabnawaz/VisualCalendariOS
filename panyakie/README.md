A visual calendar for kids for the Bing Fund Hackathon for Autism [http://www.bingfund.com/autism][]

## Problem:
*## Solution
* Use existing calendars with their
** Rich scheduling tools
** Deep integration on mobile phones like the iPhone
** Rich desktop calendar apps like iCal, Exchange
** Great features like repeating events
** Tools familiar to parents so they don't have to learn a new calendar app
* Build an app that shows the calendar visually

## How the app works:
* Create a separate calendar for your child using your favorite service/app like Exchange/Google Calendar or iCloud.
* Make sure the calendar is accessible on the phone by adding it in the Settings app under 'Mail, Contacts, Calendars'
* Launch the app, allow access to your calendars and the app will prompt you to choose your child's calendar
* The app looks at the title of each event and if it finds keywords like breakfast, bus, lunch and recess, it converts the event to a card with an image.
* The app only shows 3 events at a time. The current event is front and center while the previous and next event are smaller.
* The end result is that the child gets to quickly see what they just did what they're doing now and what's coming up next.
